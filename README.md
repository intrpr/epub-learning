# Learning to make, format ePub documents
This is an experiment in learning how to create, design, format, layout, and produce ePub documents. I've chosen work from the illustrous Bill Bryson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bryson), whose work is outstanding, as the text for these experiments. These documents are not for resale and every intent has been made to use these materials via “Fair Use,” (§107 to 118, Title 17, US Code) for experimentation only. 
Don't do dumb things.
